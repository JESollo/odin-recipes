        <p>While hard work and sweat are made in the gym, <em>athletes</em> are truly made in the kitchen!</p>
        <p>The perfect athlete is like a well-tuned sports car; it will perform based on the fuel you give it. So unless you want to run your car into the ground, you better give it <em>premium</em> fuel to maximize performance!</p>
        <p>Now, for all you new to preparing meals for athletes (whether you're aiming to fuel a significant other, child or turn yourself into a future athlete) it is important to include the premium fuel required for consumption: <em><strong>carbohydrates, proteins and fats.</strong></em></p>
        <p>Without getting into the nitty-gritty of sports-science and nutrition, the bottom-line is: if you're going to be working hard, you're going to need to consume calories! And not just any calories! Athletes will need to consume <em>PLENTY</em> of carbohydrates, proteins and fats to not only supplement the loss of fuel from physical activities (running, game-practice, strength training etc.) <strong>BUT ALSO</strong> to repair muscle fibre while packing on more muscle mass. That's <em>A LOT</em> to keep in mind while cooking!</p>
        <p>While this may seem like a barrier-of-entry for living a healthy lifestyle, it really doesn't have to be that complicated!</p>
        <p>That's the beauty of pasta! Pasta is so versatile and nutrient dense - <em>and super easy to prepare</em> - that it checks all the boxes required for maintaining an athlete!</p>
        <p>For example, take a look at the nutritional content of this pasta recipe!</p>
